Lynn Wunderli is a dog trainer par excellence. I have been so grateful to refer my clients and patients to her for the past 3 years when behavioral problems arise. During an in-home consultation, Lynn can identify the roots of the misbehavior and guide the owner through corrective training. She has time and time again restored the harmony in the human animal bond. And her training classes are a great foundation for owners of puppies and adult dogs alike. Start your dog off on the right paw with Wunderdog training!
