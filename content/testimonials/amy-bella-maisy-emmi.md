Lynn helped me and my pups so much! I have a sweet puggle pack of 3 females and they get along marvelously but all have their very unique personalities and roles in their pack. Bella is my very secure oldest gal who really "goes with the flow". Emmi is the youngest, but definitely likes to be in charge of the group. :-) Maisy, coming from quite a troubled past, has adjusted very well, but is somewhat insecure and has some guarding tendencies. She really prefers that no men enter the house, and that included my husband (now ex). Over 3 years, this problem never resolved and I can only imagine what brought on Maisy's fear, as she was kept in a cage for the first 4-5 years of her life as a puppy mill breeding dog prior to my rescue-so sad!!!!

I had worked with another training group to help Maisy to no avail. No amount of super yummy treats or behavioral conditioning made a dent in Maisy's over-reactive behavior towards men. She never bit anyone, but certainly acted as that was the next step. It made everyone in the house very uncomfortable, and I can only imagine the stress Maisy was feeling.  This made me sad for her.

So, I was lucky enough to meet Lynn at a social event and called upon her help!  She came to my home and spent a few hours with me and my girls. While we were just chatting and getting to know each other and she was gathering information about them, she was able to explain clearly to me the goals for each member of my puggle pack. We had some work to do and I was willing to try.

Lynn even emailed me a very clear and concise training plan the next day which outlined our goals for the program and the steps we would need to take to remedy the problem and prepare Maisy. It was very detailed and she had specific things that I could do right away.

One goal that I hoped to achieve by hiring Lynn was to ease Maisy's discomfort around men in general, and especially a special one that she would be meeting very soon that had come into my life recently. I was nervous about what her behavior would be towards him and really wanted everything to go smoothly. This may not have been a "make-or-break-it" situation, but I wanted to do everything in my power to improve things for Maisy.

Well, with some creative and solid training with Maisy, I am happy to say the meeting with the new man went fabulously. For months prior to their meeting, we got Maisy used to his scent and voice that she would encounter upon his visit. Yes, there were ways to do this prior to the meeting and they were creative!!

I was so relieved and really owe Lynn so much for helping me to create a safe and loving environment for my Maisy (and the others) while easing the tension I had in anticipation of the meeting.  Maisy responded so well, it really shocked me and I was amazed at how well things went.

Lynn had a wonderful way of caring for my pups, acknowledging their differences (and appreciating them), while helping me understand how all of their interactions with each other affected Maisy's behavior. She also explained how I could change my own behavior which was contributing to some of Maisy's insecurities. She explained things clearly and I could tell she really cared for us.

I cannot say enough good things about Lynn and her approach to training. She is competent, kind and has a heart of gold. I would say she seemed to care about my girls as much as I do.

Thank you Lynn for all you have done for us!!!
