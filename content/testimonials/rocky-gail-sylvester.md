Our precious little girl. A Chocolate brush coat Chinese Shar Pei was born 21 November 2014 in Farmington Iowa. When we contracted Lynn she was about 7 months old. She had some issues! She would jump on our grandchildren (3 and 5) years old. Bark at everything and anything. Would not listen to the command "come."" She had a mind of her own...

After a couple sessions and guidance from Lynn, our little girl is a perfect dog. She no longer jumps, barks excessively, and she comes when told. Our little girl (Chloee) took to Lynn like we have never seen before!

Lynn is wonderful, just like the name of her service, Wunderdog.

We will and are recommending Lynn to everyone we meet. She is truly the female version of Cesar Milan.
