Little did I know when I insisted to my husband that we get a boxer we would end up with a "marley" we call her Jinx. initially we tried traditional training with puppy classes. Lets just say that didnt go so well and we were asked to consider private lessons. We did pursue this with your traditional hand signals and treat rewards but we still did not have the dog we wish we had.  Jinx was not obedient, she jumped, chased bikers walkers and runners, and had terrible separation anxiety.

Thankfully our friend Cathy insisted we give Lynn a try and we had seen all the hard work she had done with their dog. In one visit with the introduction of the e collar we had made significant progress. Jinx was a different dog and we were able to keep her from jumping on people and she was better when playing with other dogs. she is more relaxed, doesnt chase down the runners or bikers during our walks. Dont get me wrong Jinx is not perfect by any means but Lynn helped us form a better bond with her rather than consider giving her up to another family.  The boys get to keep their favorite cuddler and we now have as Lynn would say our Jinxy-doodle. Lynn is a true dog whisperer.
