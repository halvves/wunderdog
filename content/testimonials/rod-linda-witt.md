Our dog, Annie, is a fourteen month old rescue dog of an unknown lineage, but certainly with some American Bulldog background. It was several weeks after adoption that we began to notice signs indicating Annie was deaf, which was later verified by our veterinarian. Annie had a number of behavioral problems that were compounded by her deafness. These included aggressively jumping on or otherwise bothering guests or company and trying to escape if not closely controlled when taken outside. Her deafness also complicated our efforts to train her in that unless she was looking directly at us we had no means of even getting her attention. After several months of attempting to train Annie ourselves we realized the task was beyond our capabilities and that we needed more professional assistance.

Based on recommendations, our own research and personal interview we selected Lynn Wonderli of Wunderdog, LLC to provide that support. Lynn first work with us in developing a set of hand signals for controlling basic aspects of Annie’s behavior as well as educating us on basic aspects of canine behavior and psychology as they applied to controlling behavior. While we saw immediate results in Annie’s conduct it was very apparent that the interaction between her personality and her deafness limited training beyond a basic level. It was at this point that Lynn’s knowledge and experience with electronic training aids became invaluable. Lynn recommended we purchase an electronic collar, which we did, and has since worked with us and Annie in its use.

At this time Annie’ behavior with visitors to our house has drastically improved and is no longer a serious problem. She responds readily to basic hand signals, sits and waits for us to first go through a door before following and readily obeys other commands. Most striking is that she can now be taken outside and let off her leash without trying to escape. The use of the electronic collar allows us to let her romp and play outside while ensuring that she will not run away and will return to us when signaled.

All of this can be directly attributed to the assistance of Lynn Wonderli and her vast store of dog related knowledge. We have found her to be unrelentingly cheerful, accommodating in terms of meeting times and willing to adapt to our needs and preferences. In short we are very happy with our choice of Lynn as Annie’s trainer and grateful to her for helping us enjoy our dog so much more. We would strongly recommend her to others in need of a trainer.
