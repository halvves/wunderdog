Abbey came to me by way of divine intervention. I had been a care-giver for my 97 year old father for almost eight months, 24/7, and lost him on Christmas Day, last year. I slipped into a very dark place, not knowing how to begin living again. On January 24th, 2015, Miss Downton Abbey came to me through [tracysdogs.com](http://tracysdogs.com), a San Antonio, TX, dog rescue where she was hours from being euthanized. I chose her from 80 or more dog videos and immediately felt a long-range connection to her. When she arrived, and I held her in my arms the first time, I felt my deceased parents had hand-picked her from above to come and help me begin re-crafting the rest of my life.

I am a first-time dog owner at 62 years old, living in a 2nd floor condo on the northeast side of Madison. Caring for a little "fur-baby" meant walking up / down 14 steps every time we needed to go out the back door or taking an elevator to go down and out the front floor. And this would be for the rest of our lives together. I quickly realized I needed help to properly guide Abbey to a life of respect, honor and safety. A rescue dog often comes onboard with many fears and anxieties that need to be replaced with leadership and trust. How we "lead by example" determines the quality of life we both will share from the moment we meet.

Lynn "the Wunder Dog Trainer" Wunderli, came recommended by a dear friend. Lynn’s initial visit was nothing short of genius, her positive interaction and exchange with Abbey was on a level I have never seen experienced. Lynn, was a "dog whisperer." She connected with Abbey on a whole different level. Lynn quietly called out to me all the behaviors Abbey was demonstrating so that I would learn to "read" Abbey from that day on. How Abbey gazed at me, her submissive behaviors, the licking of her lips when she was anxious, the desire to please as she was learning commands and the choosing to follow what was asked.

Lynn is a "details oriented" instructor. She had custom tailored a sheet addressing Abbey’s specific behaviors and what I should begin to work on. I immediately put together an "Abbey the Wunder Dog" Notebook where I put all our weekly handouts, and highlighted what our objectives were. We crafted a long-range plan and a short-range plan for what Abbey and I, as a team, hoped to accomplish. Lynn helped me to achieve Abbey’s "Canine Good Citizen" award for discipline and obedience in less then 5 months.

Lynn is very generous with her time. When she offers instruction for an hour, it turns into way more because she is relationship focused and in my case, took the time to bring to the surface much of the pain I was experiencing in my grief and loss. She told me how easily Abbey would pick up on my emotions and that she would come to be a tremendous comfort in my healing process. Everything Lynn spoke about, became a reality. Abbey, "my little fur-baby Wunder Dog" saved my life and does every day with her tenderness and unconditional love.

Our dogs have the ability to bring us more joy then any amount of money or tangible reward life has to offer. And once you have the tools and acquired skills, YOU have the ability to forge a lifelong relationship of love and giving.

Ask Lynn how you can be a part of such an exceptional opportunity with your dog. She is an elite trainer with decades of experience …. and her motto in teaching is "nothing in life comes for free!"

Allow your dog to perform for you, just exactly what that means!
