This past Mother's Day was truly a blessing! Dash was born into this world along with his four siblings. He spent spent the first 8 weeks on a small farm outside of Pardeeville with his siblings. On the 3rd of July we stopped "just to look" and Dash melted our hearts!

Our goals with Dash are to have a nice obedient dog. Over the past two months we have worked with Lynn and spent many hours with him learning the basics. Lynn has also taught us that we, the owners, need to be trained and all of our family need to be on the same page! Our family consists of 5 teenage girls and 4 chickens so Lynn taught us consistency is a must with our puppy.

Our little bundle of joy has made progress so far at just four months of age! Thank you Lynn!
